    message: `Greetings, Lancesoft, my name is Toby Van Baast and I'm a Web Developer from Austin. Your add on LinkedIn caught my interest.
Currently, I have been visiting family in Perth, Australia. I'll return to Austin, April 30th with an American phone number.

I have had a singular focus on learning Web Development and building projects the past 2 years, and around 5 years on and off. Some of that experience is with Python and Django; however, most of my experience is Javascript and React.

Looking at your website really resonated with me, the design language just makes sense and the message is clear and practical. 
I also enjoyed the 4 Ps.
Here are mine.
Purpose:
My purpose is to learn and put into practice what should be prioritized in order to be effective and resourceful.
People:
I strive to practice appreciation, and to realize value in others and the environment.
Performance:
I greatly appreciate quick and frequent feedback of my actions. This serves as great help in recognizing patterns and developing an awareness of effective actions.
Partnerships:
Maintaining relationships through the seasons, improves trust, loyalty, and sense of familiarity. Community makes us all accountable.

I would be absolutely pleased to work with you.
